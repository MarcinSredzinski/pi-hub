# pi-hub
Set of applications/scripts and others that will be run on my pi. 
**This code seriously violates the YAGNI principle, so if you see that it isn't followed somewhere, don't be alarmed**
The whole purpose of this project is to overengineer things for the sake of practice. 
## Content
For now the application consists of two separate parts - python scripts and .net 6 console projects. 
Console projects are rabbit mq reader and writer. The point here is to practice the usage of message queues and practice creating clean and readable code (as always, but better).
